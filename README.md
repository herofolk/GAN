# GAN
Collection of PyTorch and Keras implementations of Generative Adversarial Network varieties presented in research papers. Model architectures will not always mirror the ones proposed in the papers, but I have chosen to focus on getting the core ideas covered instead of getting every layer configuration right. Contributions and suggestions of GANs to implement are very welcomed.
